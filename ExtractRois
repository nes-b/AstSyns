# This is an ImageJ script to access bins of size, preprocess them 
# individually and count synaptic puncta.
#
# Astrocytic support of synapses is assessed by measuring homer1+ 
# synapse densities around astrocytes.
# Therefore, images of 212x212 um with central core of Ast is 
# loaded as raw .lsm file into imageJ and devided into 17 rois of 
# 27x27um that represent center - close - distant one / mid - distant - outside.
#
# First, after aligning ROIs in 2D image around astrocyte's core, 
# we extract all 17 ROIs as individual images from ImageJ's 'ROI 
# Manager' in a not as convenient, but straight forward way.
