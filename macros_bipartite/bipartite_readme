This folder contains the scripts for the bipartite synapse analysis.


FOR THE SCRIPT ExcitPreprocess

# This is an ImageJ script allowing to preprocess 2D imaging data
#
# It has been used to prepare 2D confocal images to quantify excitatory 
# synaptic puncta labeled by vGLUT1 and HOMER1 in primary human brain tissue


FOR THE SCRIPT  ExcitSynCount

# Subsequently, the SynapseCounter tool (https://github.com/SynPuCo/SynapseCounter. Accessed 6 Mar 2020)
# was run with the following params:
#
# Resize image width = 0
# Rolling ball radius = 0.0
# Maximum filter radius = 2.0
# Method for threshold adjustment = 'Default'
# Presynaptic particle size = 30
# Max presynaptic particle size = 700
# Presynaptic particle size = 10
# Presynaptic particle size = 500
#
# after a posteriori determination of real puncta in 3 images.

FOR THE SCRIPT InhibtPreprocess

# This is an ImageJ script allowing preprocessing of 2D imaging data
#
# It has been used to prepare 2D confocal images to quantify inhibitory 
# synapses labeled by vGAT1 and GEPHYRIN in primary human brain tissue.
